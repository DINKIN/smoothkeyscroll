Smooth Key Scroll
==================

Ignoring repeat rate, Smooth Key Scroll enables smooth and responsive scrolling with the keyboard, on every page you go.
It is lightweight and you won't notice it's there, it just works.

Arrow keys to move arround, Control (ctrl) and Option (alt) to increase/decrease the scrolling speed.
