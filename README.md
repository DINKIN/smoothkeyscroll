[Smooth Key Scroll](http://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gphmhpfbknciemgfnfhjapilmcaecljh)
==================
Jerky scroll? No more.

Every other extension seems to have hiccups when used with the keyboard; it shouldn't. Ignoring key repeat rate, Smooth Key Scroll provides a smooth and responsive scrolling experience with the help of experimental browser APIs like requestAnimationFrame.

Instructions
------------
* Directional keys to scroll
* Ctrl to slow down.
* Alt to speed up.

Caveats
-------
* Movement smoothness is favored over velocity constancy.
